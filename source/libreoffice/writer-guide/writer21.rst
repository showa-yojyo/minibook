Introduction
======================================================================

By default, LibreOffice Writer’s commands are grouped in cascading menus and in toolbars filled with icons—the standard user interface described in Chapter 1. These menus and toolbars are described in the chapters that discuss the related tasks and functions.
In addition, Writer provides other user interface variants, displaying contextual groups of commands and contents. This chapter describes these user interface variants and provides a quick reference to the location of the tools and functions when using each of the variants.

Selecting the user interface
======================================================================

When you set up Writer, you can choose one of these user interfaces, and you can switch between them and the standard interface at any time.
    1) Choose View > User Interface on the Menu bar.
    2) On the Select Your Preferred User Interface dialog (Figure 1), choose one of the variants on the left. An example of the variant is shown in the Preview box on the right, along with a short description.
    3) Choose the relevant button to apply your selection to all components of LibreOffice, or only to Writer. The Writer window changes to match your selection.
    4) Click Close to close the dialog.

If you have activated experimental features (Tools > Options > Advanced), more choices may appear on the left-hand side. These choices are not described here.

Standard interfaces
======================================================================

Three of the user interface choices in Figure 1 are described in Chapter 1, Introducing Writer.
Standard Toolbar
Classic mode with two visible toolbars: standard and formatting. The sidebar shows only its tabs.
Single Toolbar
Only one toolbar with frequently used features. The sidebar shows only its Hide button.
Sidebar
The sidebar is fully opened and only one toolbar (Formatting) is showing.
The elements on each of the standard user interfaces can be modified using the View menu on the Menu bar.

Tabbed interface
======================================================================

The Tabbed interface (Figure 2) provides a familiar interface for users coming from proprietary office suites such as Microsoft Office. It includes a Menu bar, an Icon bar, a Tab bar, icons for the active tab, one or more tab-specific menus, and a Quick Menu. On Windows and Linux, the Menu bar can be hidden or displayed by clicking on the Menu Bar icon in the Icon bar (Figure 4).

In Writer, this user interface variant includes nine fixed tabs and five additional tabs. Each tab displays a set of icons grouped by context. The context can change depending on the location of the cursor or the item selected. Each tab also includes one or more tab-specific drop-down menus at the right-hand end. The Quick Menu is the same for all tabs.
The Tabbed interface can be customized using the Notebookbar tab of the Customize dialog to show and hide the individual icons on the various tabs. See Chapter 20, Customizing Writer, for more information.
If the icons on a tab do not fit into the width of the Writer window, >> appears at the end of the row. Click it to display the other commands (Figure 3).

Icon bar
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The icon bar (Figure 4) is located at the top left of the tabs.

1  Menu bar – Show / Hide the menu bar.
2  Open (Ctrl+O) – Open a file browser, where you can select the file to be opened.
3  Save (Ctrl+S) – Save the open file.
4  Undo (Ctrl+Z) – Undo the last action performed.
5  Redo (Ctrl+Y) – Redo the last undone action.
6  Print (Ctrl+P) – Open the Print dialog.

Quick menu
----------------------------------------------------------------------

At the right-hand end of the tab bar is a Quick menu (Figure 5) containing some commonly used commands and links. Some of the Quick menu items have submenus, indicated by arrows on the right.

Fixed tabs
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The fixed tabs in Writer are File, Home, Insert, Layout, References, Review, View, Extension, and Tools. The tabs are described on the following pages. The illustrations show the left and right ends of the tabs separately so they are large enough to more easily see the commands.
